Destiny Coterie is a clan performance management tool for Destiny 2.
This sounds very serious. Really, it's just an excuse for me to experiment a bit with
javascript development and the Bungie.net api.

# Anticipated Features
- Identifying/purging inactives
  - A clan admin requests a list of all members who have been inactive beyond
    X days from today, and can then choose whether to purge all or some.
    - A player's active/inactive status will be determined by calculating his/her
      % playtime to a specified threshold.
    - For each "inactive" member thus identified, the admin will optionally be
      able to review that member's activity history before marking that member
      for removal
- Applicant review
  - a clan admin can review relevant information concerning the applicant, including
    play schedule, playstyle (game type preferences, stats). This probably ties
    in with "Member performance metrics/analysis"
- Member performance metrics/analysis
  - Scheduling (which players play when?)
  - PvP playstyle/performance
    - K/D stats, including stats over time
    - Weapon preferences/effectiveness
